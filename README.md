# Odin Recipes

This is my first project from **The Odin Project**!  
The goal of this project is to build a simple recipe website using only **HTML**.

## What this project is about
The website will consist of a main index page with links to a few recipes.  
Each recipe page will include:
- A title and description  
- A list of ingredients  
- Step-by-step cooking instructions  

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, Iâ€™ll have practiced:
- Setting up a Git repository  
- Using the command line and basic Linux commands  
- Writing clean, semantic HTML  
- Using Git commands like `add`, `commit`, and `push`  
- Organizing files in a project folder structure
